Running the Server
------------------

Go into your app directory and run the server

.. code:: bash

    cd /var/www/graojs-apps/my-first-app
    node index.js

And now you can navigate on your browser using the default ports (8 instances by default):

- http://localhost:8015
- http://localhost:8016
- (...)
- http://localhost:8022

Do you want to change the number of instances available? Check :doc:`../reference/config`.
